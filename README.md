# Project 1 - *Simple Todo*

**Simple Todo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Priyanka Karki**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

## Notes

While I was completing the work with the tutorial I was able to implement all of the features, but after adding the list of items persistence, the app has continued to fail removing items, as well as the persistence. The terminal primarily displays this error as the app crashes when there is a long press to delete an item or when the app is restarted to show the item persistence, as shown above in the walkthrough.
