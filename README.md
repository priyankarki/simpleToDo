**Simple Todo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Priyanka Karki**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

## Notes

While I was completing the work with the tutorial I was able to implement all of the features in the code. However, after adding the list of items persistence, the app fails to remove items and the persistence of items causes the app to crash. The terminal primarily displays the error below, as the app crashes when there is a long press to delete an item or when the app is restarted to show the item persistence, as shown above in the walkthrough.
